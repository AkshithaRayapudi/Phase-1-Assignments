        <h3>Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Pikachu is the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, and one of the main characters of the Pokémon anime series. It has also appeared in most Pokémon video games and merchandise. In the video game Pokémon Yellow, it is the player's starter Pokémon. In the anime series, Pikachu is Ash's first Pokémon.

            Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon, which attacks using electricity from two red pouches on its cheeks.
            
            Pikachu evolves from a baby Pokémon called Pichu if it loves its trainer. Pikachu can evolve into Raichu, which is darker orange than Pikachu, if a Pikachu evolves in Alola the Raichu it evolves into has the ability to fly and use its tail kind of like a hoverboard.</h3>

        <h2>The Journey of Ash and Pikachu.</h2>
        <h3>Join Ash and his loyal companion Pikachu as they travel across the region of Kanto, conquering gym battles and making new friends along the way. Ash Ketchum, an ambitious young boy from Pallet Town, had one dream: to become a Pokémon Master.While the series never outright confirms what makes Pikachu special or rare, it's evident that it is more powerful and different from others of its kind. There is a possibility that Ash's Pikachu is maxed out at level 100 without evolving, explaining its dominance in Pokémon battles.</h3>
