    <h3>Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Pikachu
        is
        the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, and one of the main characters of the Pokémon anime series. It has also
        appeared in most Pokémon video games and merchandise. In the video game Pokémon Yellow, it is the player's
        starter
        Pokémon. In the anime series, Pikachu is Ash's first Pokémon. Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon, which attacks
        using electricity from two red pouches on its cheeks. Pikachu evolves from a baby Pokémon called Pichu if it
        loves
        its trainer. Pikachu can evolve into Raichu, which is darker orange than Pikachu, if a Pikachu evolves in Alola
        the
        Raichu it evolves into has the ability to fly and use its tail kind of like a hoverboard.</h3>
